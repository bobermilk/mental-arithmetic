todo:
1. skip button
2. random seed should be room code (regenerate)
3. concurrent 1v1 like typeracer
4. have a rules text box that the host can write, with the yet to start thing
5. try to hit more distinct questions for random (so biased randomness)
6. have a score screen and lobby/global leaderboards (implement a sign in or something)

8. implement a clear keybind to make erase answers without backspace
9. fix sliders
10. combo based scoring
11. add time spent on each question in the final evaluation
